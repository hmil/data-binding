# UI data binding


Demonstration of a few popular methods to perform data binding in web user interfaces.

See the [**blog post**](https://code.hmil.fr/2021/09/how-ui-frameworks-grab-control/) for details.

Note: the "frameworks" implemented in this proof of concept only sufficiently work to support the specific examples provided here.
Any attempt to modify the components will likely result in the examples not working.

The point is just to demonstrate the basic principles behind some popular web frameworks, but not to provide an _actual usable_ implementation of the principle.

## Running

```
npm install # install dependencies
npm run compile # Compile the svelte-like example
npm start # run the demo
```
